It's that easy.

And because ClassMarker is online, there's no software installations for you or your users, so tests can be taken instantly, 24/7.

Be confident knowing the tests you create, will have the professional look you require."
    </p></div>
    <h2>How do I create an account and can I have a free trial?</h2>
    <div><p>You can register for free with ClassMarker and youâ€™ll be able to use the system for free for 30 days. This way you can trial the system and clarify any questions you may have before making any commitments.</p></div>
    <h2>What is the difference between an Education and Business account?</h2>
     <div><p>ClassMarker offers a discounted price strictly for non-profit educational testing only. If your business is in the education sector but is a for-profit organization you are required to subscribe to a business account. Please contact us if you are unclear which package is right for you.
    </p></div>
    <h2>What is the cost for using ClassMarker?</h2>
     <div><p>"ClassMarker does not charge per user, question or test created. You can store as many questions, tests and users (unlimited non-registered users, up to 1000 registered users per ClassMarker account) as you like within ClassMarker; you will only ever use your credits when a test is taken. Each time a test is taken one credit is used. If you have one test and five users take it you will use five credits.

Please view our Pricing page for details on the Professional plans and Credit packs we have available."

Note: The next payment method will incur a $50.00 USD fee to cover administration and international transfer fees charged by banks.

    International transfer / Bank transfer: For a faster processing time you are able to pay via bank transfer. Please contact us for payment details and make sure to include your ClassMarker account username when using this payment method.

    <h2>What do I need to do when my Credit pack or Professional plan is nearing the expiry date, or has expired?</h2>
     <div><p>"When your Credit pack or Professional plan is nearing it's expiry date you should assess your credit usage, review account options and then decide which will suit you most.

You can renew your existing account option, or you can choose something different to suit your current needs.

Professional plans offer 400 or 1000 credits per month for a 12 month period. These yearly account plans are perfect for regular testing. (Unused credits do not roll over.)

Credit packs offer a bundle of credits that are valid for use for 12 months from the purchase date. If your Credit pack is nearing the expiry date you can make any purchase (either Credit pack or Professional plan) and you will extend the expiry date of your existing Credit pack for another year. This option is great for bulk or occasional testing.

Don't forget: You can always 'top-up' your Professional plan with a Credit pack if you go over your monthly credit allowance.
